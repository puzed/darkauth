This release stabilizes token issuance and demo authentication flows, tightens darkauth-client publishing, and refines CI coverage for brochureware screenshots.

## 🛠️ Improvements

### 📦 Darkauth Client Publishing
- Added a package files allowlist with dist output, LICENSE, and README
- Added a prepack build step and enabled TypeScript declaration output
- Normalized the package name to `@darkauth/client` and removed the private flag

### 🔁 Demo Auth Reliability
- Gated ZK login parameters in the client and passed ZK config into the demo app setup
- Synced workspace lockfile and demo auth helpers for consistent pretest setup

### 🧰 CI Coverage
- Sharded brochureware screenshot suites with clearer job names
- Skipped the e2e suite in the main test job and collected screenshot artifacts earlier

## 🐛 Fixes

### 🔐 Issuer Consistency
- Signed ID tokens using the configured issuer to keep auth flows aligned

## 🧪 Tests

- Added darkauth-client coverage for login initiation parameter gating
- Stabilized demo auth flow coverage in the test suite
