This release introduces automated release management with GitHub synchronization and improved CI/CD workflows for Docker image management.

## ✨ Features

### 📦 Release Automation
- **GitHub release synchronization** - Pull and push releases with `scripts/pull-github-releases.sh` and `scripts/push-github-releases.sh`
- **Robust error handling** - Better `gh` CLI error handling and simpler header normalization
- **Automatic sync from GitHub** - Pull script now always overwrites from GitHub and strips stray front-matter separators

### 🐳 CI/CD Enhancements
- **Automated Docker tagging** - New workflow to retag Docker images on GitHub release
- **Smart version management** - Skips prereleases and updates `latest` tag only for stable releases

## 🛠️ Improvements

### UI Enhancements
- **Improved changelog rendering** - Refined Admin UI and brochure site changelog display with clearer headers, bullets, and spacing
- **Consistent formatting** - Ensures readable, uniform formatting across all changelog entries

## 📚 Chores
