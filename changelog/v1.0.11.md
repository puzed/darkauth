This release unlocks full admin OTP self-service, delivers an embedded demo server with modern styling, automates OpenAPI generation straight from controller schemas, and hardens authorize flows while tightening workspace tooling, dependencies, and collateral.

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Admin OTP Stewardship
- Added comprehensive admin OTP management including setup, verification, reset, disable, and backup code flows with refreshed UI states and QR provisioning
- Extended admin OTP APIs to expose status, setup-init, setup-verify, reset, disable, and verify endpoints consumed by the new management experience

### 🧩 Embedded Demo Experience
- Replaced the demo app’s standalone servers with an embedded Node server module and consolidated routing, context, and models for easier distribution
- Adopted CSS Modules across the demo UI, refreshing layout, dashboard, editor, and sharing views with scoped styling to match the rest of the workspace

## 🛠️ Improvements

### 🧾 OpenAPI Source Of Truth
- Regenerated the OpenAPI document from controller-level schema definitions, aligning every admin and user endpoint with shared validation and cutting redundant docs

### 🛠️ Tooling And Logging Discipline
- Introduced a workspace build orchestration script, tightened TypeScript configs, centralized OPAQUE lifecycle wiring, and replaced ad-hoc console logging with structured logger services across admin, user, and demo apps
- Ensured Docker images include required workspace scripts and kept KEK/OPAQUE services flowing through context for consistent lifecycle management

### 🧹 Collateral And Repo Hygiene
- Corrected changelog ordering, restored the missing v1.0.4 entry, refreshed brochure collateral, and removed compiled marketing assets from version control in favor of generated outputs

### 📦 Dependency Refresh
- Updated package manifests and lockfiles across every workspace package to pick up the latest build, runtime, and toolchain fixes

## 🐛 Fixes

### 🔁 Authorization Flow Hardening
- Added detailed authorize logging on the API, stabilized secure storage handling, and preserved redirect state through the user UI to keep OAuth hand-offs reliable across browser refreshes
- Patched the demo app authorize callback to handle database row counting edge cases and refined dark-mode styling to avoid regressions during the flow

## 📚 Documentation

- Reminded contributors to run `npm run tidy` and `npm run build` before finishing tasks, and published an incremental refactor checklist that tracks progress toward the code guide across API and demo app packages
