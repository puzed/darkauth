# Static Serving & Proxy Host Improvements

## 🚀 Server & Config

**Static file serving**
- Serve Admin and User UIs directly from the API in production with safe path resolution and correct content types

**Proxy and origins**
- More robust proxy host resolution, CORS handling, and dev vs. production behavior for both Admin and User servers

**Theme bootstrap in config**
- Inject light/dark theme bootstrap via `/config.js` for consistent initial render across UIs

**OpenAPI dependency**
- Moved `zod-to-openapi` to runtime dependencies for stable OpenAPI document generation

## 📰 Changelog Delivery

**Admin UI**
- Fetches changelog from `darkauth.com`; removed local dev/build changelog route

**Brochure Site**
- Dropped changelog plugin; generate changelog JSON via a dedicated script

**Docs**
- Clarified how changelog hosting works and where the Admin UI reads from

## 🧪 Test Suite
