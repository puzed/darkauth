This release strengthens OPAQUE authentication with enumeration resistance, targeted admin rate limits, and server-bound identity checks. It also gates self-registration behind a setting, hardens the install lifecycle, and adds inline client actions in the Admin UI, alongside broad test stability work and documentation updates.

## ✨ Features

### 🔧 Admin UI Enhancements
- Inline actions on the Clients table with styles moved to CSS

## 🛠️ Improvements

### Authentication Hardening
- Normalize OPAQUE login to avoid account enumeration
- Bind OPAQUE finish to server session identity for account lookup
- Rate-limit admin OPAQUE login (start/finish) with a dedicated bucket
- Harden install lifecycle with initialized checks, token TTL, and single-use tokens
- Enforce a single bootstrap admin and bind email during install

### Configuration & Behavior
- Gate self-registration behind a setting and hide signup by default in the User UI
- Exclude test files from the API TypeScript build
- Controller–model separation in the API for simpler data access

## 🐛 Fixes

- Branding preview iframe behavior

## 🧪 Tests

- Add identity-binding tests for OPAQUE finish (admin and user flows)
- Add admin OPAQUE login rate-limit coverage and settings toggle verification
- Add install token lifecycle tests
- Share and cache admin auth helper (`getAdminBearerToken`) across suites
- Adjust backoff, retries, and suite isolation for rate-limited paths
- Multiple stability tweaks and reload token bumps

## 📚 Chores

- Document OPAQUE identity binding, enumeration resistance, and rate limiting
- Mark phases complete for self-registration gating, admin rate limits, and enumeration hardening
- Document controller–model separation and update project guide
- Update brochure site changelog data and general linting/cleanup
