This release hardens client security with fragment-only DRK delivery and secure key storage, and introduces a new User Dashboard powered by fresh API endpoints.

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Fragment-Only DRK Delivery & Client Key Security
- Require fragment-only delivery of DRK JWE in the client and verify via `zk_drk_hash`
- Validate `zk_pub` as P-256 JWK in the API and remove persisted `drk_jwe` server-side
- Add secure export key storage in User UI with async migration and aggressive clearing of sensitive flow data

### 🖥️ User Dashboard
- Add User UI dashboard with CSS Modules styling
- Fetch and display user apps with a new API surface
- Introduce `/apps` endpoint and client metadata to power the dashboard

## 🐛 Fixes
