Generate the markdown changelog body for the provided release version.

Rules:
- Read some of the other changelog files, so you understand the feel, tone, structure of them and be consistent in yours
- Do not include any front matter or metadata lines (date/title/commits/reviewed) or a leading `---`
- Do not create or modify any files.
- Do not attempt to publish a release.
- You may use read-only commands to inspect files and git history if available.
- Use parallel agents when exploring.
- Output the markdown changelog body only, with no extra text.
