This release delivers critical security hardening from a comprehensive audit, upgrades the demo app to Tailwind CSS v4, refreshes workspace dependencies, and expands end-to-end test coverage.

## 🛠️ Improvements

### 🔐 Security Audit Remediations
- Added missing session validation and write role checks to permission create/delete endpoints
- Enforced rate limiting on registration and password change endpoints to prevent brute force and enumeration attacks
- Changed password set authorization from any admin role to require write access
- Made registration responses generic to prevent user enumeration
- Replaced custom constant-time compare with `crypto.timingSafeEqual()` to prevent timing attacks
- Standardized forbidden errors to consistently return HTTP 403 responses
- Removed sensitive authorization codes from log messages

### 🎨 Tailwind CSS v4 Migration
- Migrated demo-app styling to Tailwind CSS v4 with new `@theme` configuration

- Updated Biome 2.2.4 to 2.3.11, Drizzle 0.44.5 to 0.45.1, Playwright 1.55.1 to 1.57.0
- Refreshed Radix, TipTap, prosemirror, and other workspace dependencies
